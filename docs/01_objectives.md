# Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are focused on building strong, practical Linux
infrastructure foundations through hands-on experimentation and documentation.
Rather than targeting a single tool or platform, the goal is to develop
transferable skills applicable to real-world infrastructure and cloud-native
environments.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Strengthen Linux System Administration Fundamentals
- Install and operate Linux-based systems on bare-metal infrastructure
- Manage network interfaces, services, and system resources
- Understand how Linux behaves as a host for virtualization and containers

### 2. Implement Bare-Metal Virtualization Using Proxmox
- Deploy Proxmox as a Type-1 hypervisor
- Configure bridges and networking for management and VM traffic
- Manage virtual machine lifecycle (creation, templates, resource allocation)
- Understand the interaction between Linux, the hypervisor, and guest systems

### 3. Build a Reproducible Infrastructure Environment
- Design an environment that can be recreated consistently
- Maintain clear separation between infrastructure layers
- Document configuration decisions and operational trade-offs

### 4. Prepare the Foundation for Kubernetes-Based Orchestration
- Design Linux virtual machines suitable for Kubernetes workloads
- Understand infrastructure requirements for container orchestration
- Prepare the environment for running multiple isolated services
- Enable controlled deployment of different software versions

## Secondary Objectives

### 5. Support Multi-Version Software Management Scenarios
- Host multiple instances of management software in parallel
- Maintain isolation between services and versions
- Enable quick validation and troubleshooting of version-specific issues

### 6. Improve Infrastructure Documentation Practices
- Treat documentation as part of the engineering process
- Capture design decisions, errors, and fixes
- Create documentation that is useful for both learning and operations

### 7. Develop Troubleshooting and Diagnostic Skills
- Identify and resolve Linux networking and virtualization issues
- Use logs, system tools, and methodical debugging approaches
- Build confidence in diagnosing infrastructure-level problems

## Long-Term Objectives

While the initial phase focuses on foundational infrastructure, the project is
designed to evolve toward more advanced goals, including:

- Kubernetes cluster deployment and lifecycle management
- Observability and monitoring of infrastructure services
- Infrastructure automation using Linux-native tooling
- Application of security and isolation best practices

---

These objectives guide the technical decisions made throughout the project and
serve as a reference point for evaluating progress as the infrastructure
evolves.
